# Movie and TV list App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

An application was developed using **https://www.themoviedb.org/** to list movie and tv with ReactJs.

Since a single scrolling area is developed on the homepage, there was not enough height for the title animation to be clear, and the spacing was given slightly longer than the referenced implementation **https://www.themoviedb.org/**.

As a result of my research, I realized that the API does not provide free to watch data. That's why I used the popular data. **https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/5fafd41ed55e4d003dcf6232**

The detail page of the project is managed through a single detail page. Because there were no different areas for movie and TV on the detail pages. But if there were different fields, it would be managed with two detail pages.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find an API to list the last 3 searched data, so the search field was only added visually.
